# 🧠 ThoughtOps Workflows

Welcome to the official repository for **ThoughtOps-generated `n8n` workflows**.

Every folder here contains a complete automation package:

-   ✅ Fully structured `n8n` workflow in JSON format
    
-   🧾 Plain-English summary of the automation
    
-   🧠 Diagram or flowchart image (whiteboard-style)
    
-   📎 Notes on services/APIs involved
    

---

## 📁 Structure

Each directory is auto-generated based on your spontaneous idea or business need. Inside you'll find:

```bash

/{workflow-name-slug}/
  ├── workflow.json         # Paste this into a blank n8n canvas
  ├── README.md             # Description, setup info, and logic
  └── diagram.png           # Visual of the flow
```
